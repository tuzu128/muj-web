    <h1>This is title</h1>

    <p>
        Over the years Dracula has grown to support many more editors.
        With that came the challenge of supporting a myriad of editors, terminals, shells, and more in the same repository.
        Some package managers require specific files and layouts which cause conflicts and make it harder to maintain.</p>
    <p>
        So it was decided to change Dracula from a one repository theme to an organization.
         All themes have now been migrated to their own repository. 
         With this change we can better support package managers, list maintainers,
         make installation instructions easier to find, and support independent releases.
